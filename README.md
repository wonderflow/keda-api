# README

This is a **non-official, partially copy-paste repo of [keda](https://github.com/kedacore/keda)** that only contains API package of it.


Mainly to reduce the large dependency contains in the original repo. So that others could use this separate package as SDK to create K8s Object of keda.


This repo will be deprecated once there's any similar official package can help doing so.
